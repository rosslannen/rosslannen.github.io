- 1 oz Lime Juice
- 4 oz Ginger Beer

## Directions
1. Fill a copper mug with ice.
1. Pour vodka and lime juice into the mug.

## Variations
Instead of Vodka, you can use:

- Tequila for a Mexican Mule.
- Gin for a London Mule. Mint and simple syrup can also be added to make a Gin Gin Mule.
- Bourbon for a Kentucky Mule.
- Scotch for a Glasgow Mule.
- Rum for a Jamaican mule. For a Dark and Stormy, cut back on the lime, and serve in a highball glass.
