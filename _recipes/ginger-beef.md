Ginger Beef adapted from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's *The Wok* to be safe for Jared's diet.

## Ingredients

### Beef
- 1 lb beef - sliced for stir fry (see notes for cut and slicing)
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 2 tsp coconut aminos
- 1 tsp Shaoxing wine, dry sherry, or Mirin
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp cornstarch

### Sauce
- 2 tbsp coconut aminos
- 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine or Mirin
- 2 tsp sugar
- Pinch of ground white pepper
- Pinch of MSG
- 2 tsp cornstarch
- 1 tbsp water

### Stir Fry
- 8 oz snow peas or snap peas - strings and ends removed
- Neutral oil (see notes)
- 2 oz fresh young ginger - peeled and minced
- 2 oz fresh cilantro or basil leaves - roughly chopped

## Directions

### Beef
1. Place the beef in a medium bowl, cover with cold water, and vigorously agitate it.
1. Drain through a mesh strainer, pressing to remove excess water. Return to the bowl.
1. Add the baking soda.
1. Vigorously massage the baking soda into the meat.
1. Add salt, coconut aminos, wine, sugar, and cornstarch.
1. Work the marinade into the meat, and leave for at least 15 minutes.

### Sauce
1. Combine coconut aminos, wine, sugar, pepper and MSG and stir to combine.
1. Combine cornstarch and water in a separate bowl and stir to combine to make a slurry. The slurry will likely separate before using it, so keep that spoon handy.

### Peas
(see notes for alternate method)

1. Par-boil peas in salted boiling water for around a minute.
1. Drain and cool the peas with cold water, or spread on a baking sheet in the fridge.

### Stir Fry
1. Heat a wok over high heat (see notes for alternate cooking).
1. Add some oil and swirl to coat. If more oil is needed between batches, add more.
1. Cook the peas in batches until they are charred on each side, but still hold their shape (~1 minute). Transfer to a large bowl when done.
1. Cook the beef in batches until the beef is no longer red (~1 minute). Transfer to the same large bowl when done.
1. Add ginger and cook until fragrant (~20 seconds).
1. Return all the peas and beef to the wok and stir to combine.
1. Add the sauce to the wok, pouring down the sides.
1. Stir the food with the sauce, ensuring beef is cooked through (~30 seconds).
1. Thicken the sauce using the cornstarch slurry, just as needed.
1. Add cilantro or basil leaves and stir to combine.
1. Transfer to the large bowl.
1. Serve with steamed rice.

## Notes
- Most cuts of beef will work, but just taste a lil different. Don't bother with anything super expensive, but chuck might also be a little tough. The original recipe recommends skirt, flank, hanger, or flap. For stir fry cut the beef into strips about 2 inches long and a 1/4 inch thick.
- I prefer avacado oil, but any neutral oil will work. The higher the smoke point the better!
- The peas could also probably be steamed in the microwave by putting the peas in a microwave safe bowl with a splash of water and microwaving for a couple of minutes.
- If you don't have a wok setup, a cast iron pan on the stove will work - just remember:
  - Let it pre-heat thoroughly
  - Work in small batches
  - Let the pan come back up to heat in between batches
