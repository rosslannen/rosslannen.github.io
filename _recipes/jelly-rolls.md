Yields: 2 dozen.

## Ingredients

### Dough
- 3/4 C   Milk
- 1/2 C   Shortening
- 1/2 C   Sugar
- 1 tsp   Salt
- 2 Packages Active Dry Yeast
- 1/2 C   Warm Water (110-115 deg)
- 4 1/2 C Sifted AP Flour
- 2 eggs

### Cream Cheese Topping
- 1 Package (8 oz) Cream Cheese, Softened
- 1 Egg Yolk
- 1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract
- 1/4 C Sugar

### Glaze
- 1 C Confectioners' Sugar
- 1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract
- 3-4 tsp Water

## Directions
1. Scald milk (heat to 180 deg. **Do not boil**).
1. Add shortening, sugar, and salt to warm milk.
1. Cool to lukewarm (about 110 deg to avoid killing the yeast).
1. Sprinkle yeast on warm water and stir to dissolve.
1. Add 1 1/2 C of flour to milk mixture.
1. Beat well by hand or with electric mixer at low speed for 1 minute.
1. Beat in eggs and yeast.
1. Gradually stir in enough remaining flour, slowly, to make a soft dough that leaves the side of the bowl.
1. Knead until smooth, satiny, and no longer sticky, about 6-8 minutes.
1. Place in lightly greased bowl and invert to grease top.
1. Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled, 1 - 1 1/2 hours.
1. Punch down and divide into two portions.
1. Roll each dough portion into a 12" x 15" rectangle.
1. Cut 1" wide strips that are 12" long.
1. Holding one end of a strip, loosely wrap the dough around forming a coil.
1. Tuck the end under and pinch to seal.
1. Place coils 2" apart on greased baking sheets.
1. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
1. In a small bowl combine cream cheese, egg yolk, vanilla, and sugar.
1. Beat until smooth.
1. Using the back of a spoon, make a 1 inch wide indentation in the middle of each coil.
1. Spoon a rounded tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture into each indentation.
1. Bake at 375 deg for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned.
1. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
1. In a small bowl combine confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and enough water to achieve drizzling consistency.
1. Drizzle over cooled rolls.
1. Store in the refrigerator.

## Notes
- Raspberry jam can be substituted for half or all of cream cheese mixture.
